I am a PhD student at Center for Music in the Brain, Aarhus University, with a background in Cognitive Science. My project concerns rhythm and groove perception in cochlear implant users and the potential for perceptual enhancement through haptic stimulation. Previously, I have been working at the Center as a research assistant as part of a project on cochlear implant users and their perception and enjoyment of music.
